/* 

  NOTE : "strict mode" must be the first executable line of code in the file. Using strict mode helps us right more secure code. Secure code meaning that strict mode makes it easier for us developers to avoid accidental errors. So basically it helps us avoid bugs into our code, mainly due to 2 reasons:
    1. strict mode forbids us to do certain things 
    2. it will create visible errors for us
