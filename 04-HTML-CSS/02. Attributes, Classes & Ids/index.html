    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <p class="first">
      Hi, I'm Jonas! I'm one of Udemy's Top Instructors and all my premium
      courses have earned the best-selling status for outstanding performance
      and student satisfaction. I'm a full-stack web developer and designer with
      a passion for building beautiful web interfaces from scratch. I've been
      building websites and apps since 2010 and also have a Master's degree in
      Engineering. I discovered my passion for teaching and helping others by
      sharing everything I knew during college. This passion led me to Udemy in
      2015, where I now have the privilege of training 2,000,000+ learners in
      the field of web development. What learners love the most about all my
      courses is the fact that I take the time to explain every single concept
      in a way that everyone can easily understand. So, do you want to learn how
      to build awesome websites with modern HTML and CSS? Looking for a complete
      JavaScript course that takes you from zero to an advanced developer? Or
      maybe you want to build modern and powerful front-end applications with
      React? Then don't waste your time with random tutorials or incomplete
      youtube videos. All my courses are easy-to-follow, all-in-one packages
      that will take your skills to the next level. These courses are exactly
      the courses I wish I had when I was first getting into web development!
      But see for yourself, enroll in one of my courses, and join 2,000,000+
      happy students today.
