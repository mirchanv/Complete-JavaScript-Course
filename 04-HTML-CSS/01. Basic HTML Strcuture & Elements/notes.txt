- HTML stand for Hyper Text Markup Language
- We use HTML to describe the content of web pages
- HTML document is made out of elements, and we write elements with an opening and closing tag.
  EX: opening tag <element> and closing tag </element>
      <h1> Hello, World! </h1>
- Every html document must start and end with html tag
- Then we usually have head and body tags
- Within the head tag we can add a title tag

<html lang="en">
<head>

</head>

</body>
