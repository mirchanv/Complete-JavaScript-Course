# Guess the Number!

The game randomly generates a secret number between 1-20. You have to try to guess the secret number. The game tells you if your guess was too high or too low. Keep guessing to find that number! Guess in as few tries as you can. Initially you start with a score of 20, and for every wrong guess the score decrements by 1. When the score is 0 it's game over.
