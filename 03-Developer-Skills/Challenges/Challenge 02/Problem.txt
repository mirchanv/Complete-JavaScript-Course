CHALLENGE #2 With AI

Let's say you're building a time tracking application for freelancers. At some point in building this app, you need a function that receives daily work hours for a certain week, and returns:
  1. Total hours worked
  2. Average daily hours
  3. The day with the most hours worked
  4. Number of days worked
  5. Whether the week was full-time (worked 35 hours or more)

TEST DATA: [7.5, 8, 6.5, 0, 8.5, 4, 0]


SOLUTION APPROACH:
-> create a main function called getWorkDetails() taking one paramater named    
   workHours that is an array. 

-> create 5 more functions to calculate the required details

-> capture the results and store them in an object and return that object from the main function named getWorkDetails()
