# Pig Game!

This game is quite simple. It is played between 2 players, and the first to reach a total of 100 wins.

# How To Play?

Each time we can roll the dice, if the dice lands a 1 then the player is switched and any current total that you had will be lost.

If the dice lands any other number apart from a 1 then it adds the results of the dice roll to the current total and the current player has the option to roll the dice again or to hold the current score and save those points.

let us assume that the current player rolled the dice 3 times; 5, 6, and 3 respectively. His current total would be 14. Now, the player does not want to risk losing his 14 points so the player can hold it. Once the player holds the points the control goes to the other player.
